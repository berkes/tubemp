> Nuke all the privacy-bugs from YouTube embeds

tubemp is a tiny web-application which creates and serves thumbnail-images from YouTube embed-codes. These images link to the video and look like embedded videos.

It offers a replacement for embedding YouTube videos on your site. A
replacement without third-party cookies and tracking "bugs" following your
visitors.

Many countries (most notably the E.U-countries) don't allow third party
trackers on many of their sites. Many site-owners don't want to place
content on their websites that allows companies like Google to track
their visitors. 

Placing an image that *looks* like a YouTube embed, but served from your
own domain, is a good solution for all this.

This tiny application aids in that.
